                    <p>
                        Born: November 16th, 2001
                        From: Frederick, Maryland
                        High Shool: Walkersville
                        College: University Of Maryland

                    <p>
                        As a Computer Science Major, I enjoy solving challenging problems 
                        using my background in Java, Linear Algebra Statistics, Discrete Math, 
                        and Optimization Algorithms. I'm most experienced in Object-Oriented 
                        Programming and creating data structures that help organize, manage, 
                        and store data.

                    <p>
                        Outside of my career path, I enjoy watching sports and anime and 
                        playing video games in my free time. My favorite sports teams are 
                        the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Ravens and Washington Capitals.
                        My favorite anime are Spy X Family, Naruto, Horimiya, Fate, and
                        Classroom of the Elite. My favorite video games are Destiny,
                        Overwatch, Minecraft, Nintendo Games, and Clash of Clans.

                    <p>
                        - Designed, implemented, and extended compilers, interpreters, parsers, 
                          and ASTs for working sub-versions of the Racket language.
                        - Developed a better understanding of the functionality of compilers for 
                          high-level languages.

                    <h3>Clustering + Sliding Midpoint kd-tree : Spring 2023</h3>
                    <p>
                        - Constructed a variant of the kd-Tree data structure that stores a 
                          set of points on a 2D grid, called a Sliding-Midpoint kd-Tree.
                        - Optimized and implemented an algorithm to make the tree/grid rebalance 
                          itself and keep cells as square as possible. 
                        - Implemented a clustering algorithm that maps points that are closest 
                          to cluster centers.
                        - Integrated software engineering, data structures, data science, and 
                          machine learning all into one project.

                    <p>
                        - Collaborated with another student in Jupyter and Google Collab.
                        - Web-scraped MyAnimeList's database and used the data to determine 
                          if there is a trend of characteristics for certain Japanese animations 
                          that contribute to their popularity.
                        - Organized, displayed, visualized, interpreted, and recorded the data 
                          using Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn libraries
                        - Increased experience with web-scraping, SQL, Beautiful Soup, 
                          data visualization, data interpretation, git, and Docker.

                    <p>
                        I have been a part of a small"ish" minecraft parkour, maze and puzzle,
                        server IP:zero.minr.org for over 10 years. This server is actually one of 
                        the longest active servers that has been running since 2010 and has had 
                        over 500,000 unique visitors. This server has over 600 challenging courses 
                        made by community members. Of these 600+, I have made two puzzle maps: 
                        Zurdite and Ikorite, that has had over 2000 completions and even more 
                        attempts!

                    <p>
                        In Spring 2023, I worked with a team of fellow students to discover the
                        rotation period of asteroid 3214 Makarenko. Over the course of the semester
                        we prepared to observe Makarenko over a 2 week period in May. During
                        observation nights, we'd stay up until 7am observing this asteroid.
                        At the end of the semseter, we published our findings in the Minor Planet
                        Bulletin for anyone to access.
